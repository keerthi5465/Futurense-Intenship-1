Overview


This repository contains examples and resources related to SQL database operations, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL), and built-in functions.

DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL commands are used to define the structure and schema of a database and its objects. These commands include:

CREATE: Create new database objects like tables, indexes, views, etc.
ALTER: Modify the structure of existing database objects.
DROP: Delete or remove existing database objects.
TRUNCATE: Remove all records from a table (while preserving the table structure).
DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DML commands are used to manage data within the database. These commands include:

SELECT: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
INSERT: Insert new records into a table.
UPDATE: Modify existing records in a table.
DELETE: Remove records from a table.
DQL (Data Query Language)
DQL is focused specifically on querying data within a database using the SELECT statement.

Built-in Functions
SQL provides a rich set of built-in functions for various purposes such as string manipulation, date/time operations, mathematical calculations, etc. Examples include:

String Functions: CHAR_LENGTH, UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTRING, etc.
Date/Time Functions: CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, DATE_ADD, DATEDIFF, etc.
Mathematical Functions: ROUND, ABS, CEIL, FLOOR, etc.
